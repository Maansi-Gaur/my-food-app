# My Food App

This is a full-stack food web application built using the MERN stack.  
The goal of this project was to understand how frontend and backend communicate in a real-world application.
Users can browse food items, view details, and interact with a responsive UI. The backend handles API routes, authentication logic, and database operations.


# What I Learned

1. Connecting React frontend with Express backend
2. Creating REST APIs
3. Working with MongoDB and environment variables
4. Implementing JWT-based authentication
5. Managing project structure for a full-stack application
6. Handling errors and debugging API calls
